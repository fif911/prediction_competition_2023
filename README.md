# Readme

This repository is currently for internal VIEWS use. It includes code to generate benchmark models for the 2023 prediction competition, as well as to evaluate the predictions. 

The benchmark models are based on the fatalities002 version of the VIEWS forecasting system (which will be set in production early 2023). To run, some .py files from the viewsforecasting repository have been copied into this repository.
